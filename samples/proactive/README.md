# Bot Framework Proactive Message Sample

This Microsoft Teams bot example uses the [msbotbuilder-go](https://github.com/wschroederga/msbotbuilder-go) library. It shows how to create a simple bot that sets conversation reference and sends proactive messages from Bot to user.

## Run the example

#### Step 1: Register MS BOT

Follow the official [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework) to create and register your BOT.

Copy `APP_ID` and `APP_PASSWORD` generated for your BOT.

Do not set any messaging endpoint for now.

#### Step 2: Run echo local server

Set two variables for the session as `APP_ID` and `APP_PASSWORD` to the values of your BotFramework `APP_ID` and `APP_PASSWORD`. Then run the `main.go` file.

```bash
export APP_PASSWORD=MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD
export APP_ID=MICROSOFT_APP_ID

go run main.go
```

This will start a server which will listen on port `3978`

#### Step 3: Expose local server with ngrok

Now, in separate terminal, run [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) command to expose your local server to outside world.

```sh
$ ngrok http 3978
```

Copy `https` endpoint, go to [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots) dashboard and set messaging endpoint under Settings.

#### Step 4: Test the BOT

You can either test BOT on BotFramework portal or you can create app manifest and install the App on Teams as mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#create-your-app-manifest-and-package).


## Understanding the example

The program starts by creating a handler struct of type `activity.HandlerFuncs`.

This struct contains definition for the `OnMessageFunc` field which is a treated as a callback by the library on the respective event.

e.g
```bash
var customHandler = activity.HandlerFuncs{
	OnMessageFunc: func(turn *activity.TurnContext) (schema.Activity, error) {
		var obj map[string]interface{}
		err := json.Unmarshal(cardJson, &obj)
		if err != nil {
			return schema.Activity{}, err
		}
		attachments := []schema.Attachment{
			{
				ContentType: "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
				Content:     obj,
			},
		}
		return turn.SendActivity(activity.MsgOptionText(activity.MsgOptionAttachments(attachments))
	},
}
```

The `init` function picks up the `APP_ID` and `APP_PASSWORD` from the environment session and creates an `adapter` using this.


A webserver is started with a handler which passes the received payload to `adapter.ParseRequest`. This methods authenticates the payload, parses the request and returns an Activity value.

```
activity, err := adapter.ParseRequest(ctx, req)
```
  

The Activity is then passed to `adapter.ProcessActivity` with the handler created to process the activity as per the handler functions and send the response to the connector service.

```
err = adapter.ProcessActivity(ctx, activity, customHandler)
```

Once the incoming activity is processed, the conversation reference is set with

```
conversationRef = activity.GetCoversationReference(act)
```

Later, proactive attachment message is sent to conversation referenced by `conversationRef`

```
err := ht.Adapter.ProactiveMessage(context.TODO(), conversationRef, attachHandler)
```

In case of no error, this web server responds with a 200 status.
